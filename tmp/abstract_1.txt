intrinsically disordered protein regions (idrs) are well established as contributors to intermolecular interactions and the formation of biomolecular condensates. in particular, rna-binding proteins (rbps) often harbor idrs in addition to folded rna-binding domains that contribute to rbp function. to understand the dynamic interactions of an idr-rna complex, we characterized the rna-binding features of a small (68 residues), positively charged idr-containing protein, small erdk-rich factor (serf). at high concentrations, serf and rna undergo charge-driven associative phase separation to form a protein- and rna-rich dense phase. a key advantage of this model system is that this threshold for demixing is sufficiently high that we could use solution-state biophysical methods to interrogate the stoichiometric complexes of serf with rna in the one-phase regime. herein, we describe our comprehensive characterization of serf alone and in complex with a small fragment of the hiv-1 trans-activation response (tar) rna with complementary biophysical methods and molecular simulations. we find that this binding event is not accompanied by the acquisition of structure by either molecule; however, we see evidence for a modest global compaction of the serf ensemble when bound to rna. this behavior likely reflects attenuated charge repulsion within serf via binding to the polyanionic rna and provides a rationale for the higher-order assembly of serf in the context of rna. we envision that the serf-rna system will lower the barrier to accessing the details that support idr-rna interactions and likewise deepen our understanding of the role of idr-rna contacts in complex formation and liquid-liquid phase separation.
