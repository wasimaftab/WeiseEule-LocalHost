emerging evidence suggests that physiological c-terminal truncation of alpha-synuclein (alphas) plays a critical role in regulating liquid-liquid phase separation and promoting amyloid aggregation, processes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson's disease (pd). however, the molecular mechanisms through which c-terminal truncation influences alphas conformation and modulates its aggregation remain poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the impact of c-terminal truncation on alphas conformational dynamics by comparing full-length alphas(1-140) with truncated alphas(1-103) monomers using atomistic discrete molecular dynamics simulations. our findings revealed that both alphas(1-140) and alphas(1-103) primarily adopted helical conformations around residues 7-32, while residues 36-95, located in the second half of the n-terminal and nac domains, predominantly formed a dynamic beta-sheet core. the c-terminus of alphas(1-140) was largely unstructured and dynamically wrapped around the beta-sheet core. while residues 1-95 exhibited similar secondary structure propensities in both alphas(1-140) and alphas(1-103), the dynamic capping by the c-terminus in alphas(1-140) slightly enhanced beta-sheet formation around residues 36-95. in contrast, key aggregation-driving regions (residues 2-9, 36-42, 45-57, and 68-78) were dynamically shielded by the c-terminus in alphas(1-140), reducing their exposure and potentially preventing interpeptide interactions that drive aggregation. c-terminal truncation, on the other hand, increased the exposed surface area of these aggregation-prone regions, thereby enhancing interpeptide interactions, phase separation, and amyloid aggregation. overall, our simulations provide valuable insights into the conformational effects of c-terminal truncation on alphas and its role in promoting pathological aggregation.
