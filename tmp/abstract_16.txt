blending multiple polymers together to form the so-called "high-entropy polymers (heps)" can generate the effects of molecular dispersion in addition to suppressing polymer phase separation. we embedded a semiconducting polymer (conjugated polymers, cps) in an optically inert matrix composed of n polymer species and found that a molecule-level dispersion is attained in heps defined as n >/= 5. in the regime of dilute cp concentrations, the photonic properties vary widely in the n = 1 matrices owing to diverse solubility parameters, but the distribution narrows with n, and the cp starts to exhibit behaviors of molecule-level dispersion at n >/= 5, where the matrix polymers compete with each other to exert direct influences on the embedded cp. specifically, for meh-ppv, increasing n reduces the fluorescence redshift and spectral width from diminishing aggregation. for the rigid pfo molecules, increasing n creates a dilution effect facilitating formation of the low-energy planar beta-phase. for the flexible regioregular p3ht-rr, heps offer well-dispersed amorphous chains highly susceptible to chain environments, thus influencing eta(r)'s in the quasi-fixed amorphous-crystalline energy transfer landscape. the hep effects continue for greater cp concentrations, consistent with the matrix dispersing behaviors in the dilute regime. this work demonstrates a molecular-level dispersion by heps, offering a method of molecular tailoring for polymer research and applications via simple mixing.
