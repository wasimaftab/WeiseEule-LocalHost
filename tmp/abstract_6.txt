ionic liquids (ils) exhibit a unique nanoscale structure (i.e., nanodomains) characterized by their organization into distinct domains. we present evidence of nanodomains in trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium chloride, [p(66614)][cl], using single-molecule tracking (smt) and the maximum entropy method (mem) to analyze single-molecule trajectories. the diffusion properties of atto 647n were assessed as the temperature of [p(66614)][cl] increased from 20 degrees c (4020 cp), 35 degrees c (1239 cp), 45 degrees c (599 cp) to 50 degrees c (439 cp). the mem analysis revealed a distinct two-population distribution of diffusion coefficients representing nanodomains in [p(66614)][cl] at 20 degrees c (4020 cp). the slow population accounts for 16%, with a diffusion coefficient of 0.104 mum(2)/s, while the fast population constitutes 84% with a diffusion coefficient of 0.634 mum(2)/s. two diffusing populations were also measured for the chemically different probes atto 647n, did, and nile blue chloride in [p(66614)][cl] at 20 degrees c. in contrast, only a single fast population was measured in [p(66614)][cl] at 50 degrees c. at a similar viscosity (640 cp) but a lower temperature of 20 degrees c, trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bis[(trifluoromethyl)-sulfonyl]imide, [p(66614)][ntf(2)], also showed only a single diffusing population. the elimination of the slow population and the presence of a single diffusing population in [p(66614)][cl] as the temperature increases and the viscosity decreases is consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation (llps) as a mechanism of nanodomain formation. in addition, the measurement of two diffusing populations for three fluorophores with different chemical structures is also consistent with a physical mechanism, and not a chemical mechanism, for nanodomain formation.
