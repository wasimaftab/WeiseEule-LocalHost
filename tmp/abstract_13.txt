the selective removal of solutes is crucial for ensuring a sustainable water supply, recovering resources, and cost-effective biomanufacturing. adsorptive membranes are promising in this regard due to their rapid mass transfer and low energy demands. however, state-of-the-art adsorptive membranes offer limited pore sizes and surface chemistries. this study reports the development of adsorptive membranes from reactive phenolphthalein-based (pph-based) polymers. these polymers, which are molecularly engineered to possess a high density of reactive pendant groups, are transformed into porous membranes through a surface-segregation vapor-induced phase separation (svips) method. examining the thermodynamic characteristics of the polymer-solvent-nonsolvent system informs the svips manufacturing process and facilitates the formation of diverse membrane morphologies with hydraulic permeabilities ranging from 3400 to 13,500 l m(-)(2) h(-1) bar(-1). copper ion binding experiments demonstrate a saturation capacity of 0.9 mmol cu(2+) g(-1), indicating high accessibility of the pendant groups for postsynthetic modification. functionalization with alkyne groups enables one-step click reactions, such as the thiol-yne and cu(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, expanding the membrane functionality. the incorporation of cucurbit[7]uril-azide macrocycles demonstrates the affinity-mediated capture of methyl viologen from solution. the combination of pph-based polymers and the svips method provides a versatile adsorptive membrane platform with a dense presentation of reactive sites, facilitating customization through diverse and high-yielding reactions.
