our goal in this study is to incorporate graphene nanoplatelets (gnps) in a polymer blend of poly(lactic acid) (pla) and isotactic polypropylene (ipp) to facilitate the dispersion of gnps and use the morphology of phase segregation to create a pathway for concentrating gnps to achieve percolation with lower gnp concentration. investigating the interfacial properties between pla/gnps and ipp/gnps, we noticed that ipp has a lower contact angle on gnps compared to pla on gnps. this showed a great potential that the gnp are easily confined in ipp rather than in pla domains or at the pla/pp interfaces. utilizing this property, as the pla content increases, the ipp content decreases, resulting in a reduction of the available space for gnps. this decrease in space leads to a higher chance for gnps to accumulate together. furthermore, through careful control of the concentration in the immiscible blend of pla/pp, it is possible to achieve a bicontinuous structure. this structure facilitates the creation of a pathway for the fillers, allowing for the use of minimal gnps while achieving optimal electrical conductivity properties. the pla/pp/gnps can be oriented by the shear forces coming from the nozzle that produce a higher performance.
