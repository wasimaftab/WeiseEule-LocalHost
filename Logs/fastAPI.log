Discovery of the role of anopheline species in malaria transmission before the turn of the past cen-
tury solved one mystery but raised another. “Anophelism without malaria” was a phrase coined to
describe regions in southern Europe where the presumed vector Anopheles maculipennis was abun-
dant but where disease transmission was sparse or nonexistent (Hackett 1937). In the early 1920s,
several researchers hypothesized that this phenomenon could be explained by the existence of
divergent “races” of A. maculipennis that were nearly identical morphologically but that differed in
behavior, ecology, and/or physiology. Research over the next two decades conﬁrmed this hypoth-
esis, and today it is known that what was once called A. maculipennis is actually a group of at least ten
Palearctic species (Harbach 2004). These species show variation in oviposition sites, host-feeding
preferences, and vector competence, which helps to explain the substantial geographic variation

in historical rates of malaria transmission across Europe. This ﬁrst discovery of sibling species in
Anopheles not only resolved the paradox of anophelism without malaria but also inﬂuenced sub-
sequent investigations of other vectors, particularly in cases in which the assumed vector species
was unusually widespread and apparently plastic in breeding habits and other behaviors. Such was
the case for A. gambiae, which was not recognized as a species complex until the second half of
the twentieth century. Below, we revisit the discovery of the complex and more recent attempts
to understand the genetic and phenotypic differences between these species.

Female Anopheles mosquitoes are mammalian ectoparasites that are dependent on a proteinaceous
blood meal for egg production. Similar to their mammalian hosts, the basal lineages of Anopheles
appear to have diversiﬁed rapidly in association with the separation of South America, Africa,
and Laurasia ∼120–95 Mya (Krzywinski et al. 2001, Nishihara et al. 2009). Efforts to reconstruct
Anopheles phylogeny have been complicated not only by these older bursts of radiation but also by
much more recent bursts leading to the many clusters (complexes) of closely related and isomorphic
sibling species typical of this taxon (Harbach 2004).
Anopheles mosquitoes also are the exclusive vectors of mammalian malaria. However, of ∼500
recognized species, only approximately two to three dozen are important vectors of human malaria,
and the vast majority of anophelines are of little or no consequence to public health (Collins &
Paskewitz 1995). In principle, the four traits needed to make a highly efﬁcient human malaria
vector are known: (a) strong preference for human blood, (b) physiological competence to parasite
infection, (c) long life, and (d ) high population density. Notably, the rare species that possess all
four of these traits are not clustered phylogenetically but rather are interdigitated with nonvec-
tor species in four of six subgenera and even in sibling species complexes. This pattern implies
recent, rapid, and repeated evolution of traits conferring vectorial efﬁciency. A trigger for the
repeated emergence of human malaria vectors in different anopheline lineages may have been
the growth of Neolithic human populations following the development of agriculture, and the
resulting environmental changes.
Identifying the yet unknown genetic differences that have allowed a handful of species to be-
come major malaria vectors is the ultimate goal motivating the complete genome sequencing and
assembly of ﬁfteen Anopheles species, a project set to launch in 2011 (Besansky 2008). Powerful
insights about the nature of key evolutionary innovations of vectors can be gained by careful com-
parison within species complexes—closely related sibling species that differ in vector status—and
across these replicate systems of vector evolution. Although many if not most malaria vectors
belong to sibling species complexes, nearly all are severely understudied. A notable exception
is the Afrotropical Anopheles gambiae complex, whose nominal species was the ﬁrst, and to date
remains the only, anopheline with a completely sequenced reference genome (Holt et al. 2002).
The morphologically indistinguishable members of this complex span the vectorial capacity gra-
dient from major vectors through minor or locally important vectors and nonvectors. Taking the
A. gambiae complex as a case study and potential model, this review aims to synthesize the substan-
tial progress made in understanding, at both the genetic and phenotypic levels, the diversiﬁcation
of these species in relation to humans, malaria, and a heterogeneous environment.
